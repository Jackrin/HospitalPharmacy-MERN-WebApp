# Hospital Pharmacy WebApp
The app was meant to be an example of a service that would be used by the hospital pharmacy and the doctors.

## Functionality

It allows the doctors to create a request that contains information about the patient and the medication needed. The request can only be seen by the doctor who submitted it and the pharmacy.

The pharmacy can then visualize the request made by teh doctors to prepare the medications. After that the pharmacy can close the request as completed.

The interface allows the user to search for words and use filters to better find the wanted request.

## Technologies used

For the app I used the MERN stack:
- MongoDB as the database, greater compatibility with a Javascript environment, and possibility in the future to add more data to the requests.
- Node.js as the backend and Express.js as framework. 
- React as javascript frontend framework.
